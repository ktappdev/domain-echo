Domain Echo - Chat with Anyone on Any Website

Transform every website into a real-time chat room. Domain Echo creates anonymous, instant chat spaces for every domain you visit, allowing you to connect with other visitors in real-time.

🌟 KEY FEATURES

• Instant Chat Rooms - Every website gets its own dedicated chat room
• Real-Time Messaging - See messages appear instantly as others type
• Complete Anonymity - No sign-ups, no accounts, just chat
• Active User Count - See how many people are online in each room
• Clean, Modern Interface - Beautiful UI that's easy to use

💬 HOW IT WORKS

1. Visit any website
2. Click the Domain Echo icon in your browser
3. Start chatting with other visitors on that domain
4. Switch tabs or domains to join different chat rooms

Each domain has its own isolated chat room. When you visit reddit.com, you chat with other Reddit visitors. When you visit youtube.com, you chat with other YouTube visitors. It's that simple.
